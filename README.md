# Infectious disease modelling case study
This code is a form form material for the summer school on "Modelling Infectious Diseases and Health Economics", which is a collaboration between the University of Antwerp and Hasselt University, Belgium.

I made modifications to this project, to perform a case study (for this summer program), about the impact of a vaccination campaign during the simulation.
